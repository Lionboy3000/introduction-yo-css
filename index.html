    <h4>Steps to make pizza at home </h4>
  <P id="mojulo">Pizza sometimes is viewed as unhealthy or even as “junk food,” but well-chosen toppings make pizza a healthful menu
option that can include all of the food groups (grain, vegetables, protein, fruit and dairy or alternative). Pizza can
vary greatly in the number of calories per slice, depending on the toppings chosen and type of crust, so check the
nutrition information on the ingredients you choose.</P>

Pizza sometimes is viewed as unhealthy or even as “junk food,” but well-chosen toppings make pizza a healthful menu
option that can include all of the food groups (grain, vegetables, protein, fruit and dairy or alternative). Pizza can
vary greatly in the number of calories per slice, depending on the toppings chosen and type of crust, so check the
nutrition information on the ingredients you choose.</P>

<P class="mojulo">Try creating personalized pizzas with each of the food groups represented and a range of topping choices. Set up a
“pizza buffet” to allow your guests to create their own pizza.</P>

<P class="mojulo">1. Start with a crust. A wide range of pizza crust mixes, pre-made crusts and refrigerated doughs are available. Try a
whole-grain crust to get the benefits of fiber and a range of vitamins and minerals. Or try making minipizzas with pita
bread, English muffin halves, bagel halves, lovash or naan as the base. Gluten-free and vegetarian crust options are
available, too.</P>

<P class="mojulo">2. Add a sauce. Go light on the sauce to avoid a soggy rust. You can use the old standby tomato-based pizza auce, such
as the provided recipe, or another sauce, such as:</P>

<p class="mojulo">>Alfredo sauce
Pesto (made of basil,
Asian peanut sauce olive oil and other
Barbecue sauce ingredients)
Hummus (seasoned chickpea dip)
Salsa</p>
<P class="mojulo">3. Add some veggies, such as:
Artichoke hearts, sliced
Red, yellow and green
Broccoli florets, roasted peppers, sliced or diced
Carrots, shredded
Spinach leaves
Mushrooms, sliced
Onion, diced
Tomatoes, diced</P>
<P class="mojulo">4. Try some fruit on your pizza, such as:

Apples, thinly sliced
Pears, thinly sliced
Mango, thinly sliced
Pineapple chunks</P>
<P class="mojulo">5. Add some protein, such as:

Bacon, cooked, drained and crumbled
Ground beef, cooked and drained
Black or white beans
Ham, cubed or sliced
Chicken, grilled
Italian sausage, cooked and drained
Crab meat cooked and drained
Egg, hard-cooked and chopped
Pork, shredded
Shrimp</P>
<P class="mojulo">6. Add cheese. Mozzarella is the typical pizza topper, but be adventuresome and explore the range of cheese options,
such as adding a sprinkle of:

Cheddar
Havarti
Swiss
Feta
Parmesan</P>
<p class="mojulo">7. Bake your creation in a hot oven (450 F or above). Adjust your baking time, depending on the number of toppings.
Consider baking your pizza on a grill to impart a smoky, grilled flavor.

¼ tsp. sugar

½ c. warm water (120 to 130 F) *

dough (13-inch circle). Brush crust with olive oil and poke with fork.
